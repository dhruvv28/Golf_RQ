## 🎯 Step-by-Step Push Instructions

### **Option 1: Push Everything at Once (Recommended)**

This is the simplest approach - commit all changes together:

```bash
# Step 1: Add all changes
git add .

# Step 2: Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Complete GPS tracking system with rover integration

- Added FileGpsService for reliable GPS polling
- Enhanced rover connection with auto-detection
- Implemented distance calculation and logging
- Added iOS permissions and configurations
- Created comprehensive documentation
- Improved accessibility with voice coaching
- Added practice session and goal tracking"

# Step 3: Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

---

### **Option 2: Push in Organized Commits**

If you want cleaner git history, break it into logical commits:

#### **Commit 1: Core GPS System**
```bash
git add lib/services/file_gps_service.dart
git add lib/screens/distance_screen.dart
git add lib/services/comms_service.dart
git commit -m "feat: Add GPS polling service with distance calculation"
```

#### **Commit 2: Rover Integration**
```bash
git add lib/screens/rover_connect_screen.dart
git add rover_http_server.py
git commit -m "feat: Enhance rover connection with auto-detection and HTTP server"
```

#### **Commit 3: iOS Configuration**
```bash
git add ios/Runner/Info.plist
git commit -m "chore: Add iOS permissions for location and network access"
```

#### **Commit 4: Dependencies**
```bash
git add pubspec.yaml
git add pubspec.lock
git commit -m "chore: Add http package for GPS polling"
```

#### **Commit 5: Main App Updates**
```bash
git add lib/main.dart
git commit -m "feat: Integrate FileGpsService into app"
```

#### **Commit 6: Documentation**
```bash
git add README.md
git add docs/
git commit -m "docs: Add comprehensive README and technical documentation"
```

#### **Push All Commits**
```bash

## 🔍 Understanding Git Status Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **M** | Modified | File was changed |
| **A** | Added | New file staged for commit |
| **D** | Deleted | File was removed |
| **??** | Untracked | New file not yet added |
| **R** | Renamed | File was renamed |

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: "Your branch is behind 'origin/main'"**
```bash
# Solution: Pull first, then push
git pull origin main
git push origin main
```

### **Issue 2: Merge Conflicts**
```bash
# Solution: Resolve conflicts manually
git status  # See conflicted files
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin main
```

### **Issue 3: Large Files**
```bash
# Solution: Check file sizes
git ls-files -s | awk '{print $4, $2}' | sort -k2 -n -r | head -10

# If files are too large, use Git LFS
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.bin"
git add .gitattributes
```

### **Issue 4: Accidentally Committed Secrets**
```bash
# Solution: Remove from history
git rm --cached path/to/secret/file
echo "path/to/secret/file" >> .gitignore
git commit -m "chore: Remove sensitive file"
git push origin main
```

## 🎨 Commit Message Best Practices

### **Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### **Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### **Examples:**
```bash
# Good ✅
git commit -m "feat(gps): Add real-time distance calculation with logging"

# Good ✅
git commit -m "fix(rover): Resolve connection timeout on iOS devices"

# Good ✅
git commit -m "docs: Update README with rover setup instructions"

# Bad ❌
git commit -m "updates"

# Bad ❌
git commit -m "fixed stuff"
```

## 🚀 Quick Push (Use This!)

**If you just want to push everything now:**

```bash
# One-liner to add, commit, and push
git add . && git commit -m "feat: Complete GPS tracking system with rover integration and comprehensive documentation" && git push origin main
```

---

## 📊 Verify Your Push

After pushing, verify on GitHub:

1. Go to `https://github.com/yourusername/smart-golf-assistant`
2. Check that all files are updated
3. Verify README displays correctly
4. Check commit history

---

## 🔧 Advanced: Amend Last Commit

If you forgot something in your last commit:

```bash
# Add forgotten files
git add forgotten_file.dart

# Amend the last commit
git commit --amend --no-edit

# Force push (only if you haven't shared the commit)
git push origin main --force
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Only use `--force` if no one else has pulled your changes!

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

For this project, I recommend **Option 1** (push everything at once):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Complete GPS tracking system with rover integration

Major updates:
- Added FileGpsService for reliable GPS polling from rover
- Enhanced rover connection with auto-detection and port scanning
- Implemented real-time distance calculation and logging
- Added iOS permissions for location and network access
- Created comprehensive documentation (README + technical docs)
- Improved accessibility with enhanced voice coaching
- Added practice session and goal tracking features
- Integrated http package for GPS data polling

This completes the core functionality for the Smart Golf Assistant
hackathon project, including rover integration, analytics, and
accessibility features for visually impaired users."

git push origin main
```
